                Dr. Ameyo Stella Adadevoh was the Lead Consultant Physician and Endocrinologist at a private hospital in
                Lagos, Nigeria where she worked for 21 years. She had never seen Ebola before but was able to diagnose
                and contain Nigeria’s first-ever Ebola patient in July 2014. When threatened by Liberian officials who
                wanted the patient to be discharged to attend a conference, she resisted the pressure and said, “for the
                greater public good” she would not release him.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since Nigeria’s health system was not prepared for an outbreak at the time, she contracted Ebola and
                died alongside 3 of her colleagues. Her heroic efforts prevented a major outbreak in the most populous
                African country and served as the catalyst for successful government action to contain the spread of
                what would have been a major outbreak in a country of more than 190 million people.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a result of her keen perception, courage, and steadfastness, all 20 Ebola cases in Nigeria were
                traced to a single path of transmission originating with the first (index) patient who took a flight
                from Monrovia, Liberia to Lagos. This is what differentiated the Ebola outbreak in Nigeria from the
                outbreaks in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, where the index patients were not initially diagnosed or
                contained.
